DETAILED CLASSIFICATION
==============================================================================

--- CareerOnToken (4 SVS / 4 CVL) ---
Safe ERC20 token. Standard transfer/approve/transferFrom.
  transferEffects [OK/ERROR]
    Transfer correctly moves balances. Property IS true.
    SVS: TN | CVL: FP (CVL flags potential overflow in balanceOf += value)
  transferFromEffects [OK/ERROR]
    TransferFrom correctly moves balances. Property IS true.
    SVS: TN | CVL: FP (same overflow concern)
  approveSetsExactValue [OK/OK]
    Approve sets exact allowance. Property IS true.
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN
  totalSupplyUnchangedForERC20Ops [OK/OK]
    ERC20 ops don't change totalSupply. Property IS true.
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN

--- StableDEX / Core (4 SVS / 5 CVL) ---
Safe ERC20 with owner-controlled mint.
  transferMovesBalances [OK/OK]
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN
  transferFromMovesBalances [OK/OK]
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN
  approveSetsAllowance [OK/OK]
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN
  onlyOwnerChangesTotalSupply [OK/ERROR]
    Only owner can change totalSupply. Property IS true.
    SVS: TN | CVL: FP (CVL constructor/method quantification issue)
  multiTransfer (CVL only) [—/ERROR]
    Unwinding condition in a loop — CVL can't unroll.
    CVL: FP

--- SushiSwap (2 SVS / 2 CVL) ---
Safe DEX with deposit/withdraw involving external IERC20.transferFrom.
  depositMintsExpectedShares [ERROR/ERROR]
    Spec: after deposit, totalBalance and totalShares increase correctly.
    Property IS true. Both tools fail due to external IERC20.transferFrom
    call modeling (havoc of external call affects proof).
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP
  withdrawBurnsSharesForAmount [ERROR/ERROR]
    Same issue with external IERC20.transfer.
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP

--- Uniswap / UniswapToken (4 SVS / 4 CVL) ---
Safe ERC20 implementing IERC20 interface.
  transferMovesBalances [ERROR/ERROR]
    Property IS true. SVS: invariant violation propagates from
    balancesNonNegative invariant. CVL: potential overflow in
    _balances[recipient] += amount.
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP
  transferFromAdjustsAllowance [ERROR/ERROR]
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP
  approveSetsAllowance [ERROR/OK]
    SVS: FP (invariant interference) | CVL: TN
  totalSupplyInvariant [ERROR/ERROR]
    No function modifies _totalSupply. Property IS true.
    SVS: FP (constructor issue) | CVL: FP

--- WETH9 (3 SVS / 3 CVL) ---
Safe Wrapped Ether contract.
  depositIncreasesBalance [ERROR/ERROR]
    Spec checks both balanceOf and contract.balance increase.
    Property IS true. Both tools fail on contract.balance tracking
    with receive()/withdraw() interactions.
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP
  withdrawDecreasesBalance [ERROR/ERROR]
    withdraw() uses transfer() (external call). Balance tracking imprecise.
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP
  transferFromRespectsAllowance [ERROR/ERROR]
    Property IS true. SVS: invariant violation. CVL: overflow concern.
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP

--- WrappedToken (4 SVS / 4 CVL) ---
Safe wrapped token with wrap/unwrap.
  wrapMintsTokens [OK/ERROR]
    SVS: TN | CVL: FP (overflow in _balances += amount)
  transferMovesBalances [OK/ERROR]
    SVS: TN | CVL: FP (same)
  transferFromAdjustsAllowance [OK/ERROR]
    SVS: TN | CVL: FP (same)
  approveSetsAllowance [OK/OK]
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN

--- Balancer (1 SVS / 1 CVL) ---
Safe AMM with swap function involving division.
  swapUpdatesPoolConsistently [TIMEOUT/ERROR]
    Spec: pool balances update correctly after swap. Property IS true
    for valid inputs. SVS times out (complex division). CVL: "Division
    by zero" — pool weights could be zero.
    SVS: FP (timeout) | CVL: FP (div-by-zero edge case)

--- Ballot (3 SVS / 3 CVL) ---
Safe voting contract.
  giveRightSetsUnitWeight [OK/OK]
    SVS: TN | CVL: TN
  delegateAddsWeight [ERROR/ERROR]
    delegate() has while loop for delegation chain. Both tools
    can't handle the loop.
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP (Unwinding condition in loop)
  voteAccumulatesWeight [ERROR/ERROR]
    Property IS true. SVS: postcondition issue. CVL: voteCount
    assertion fails (possibly due to delegation chain modeling).
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP

--- Curve (1 SVS / 1 CVL) ---
Safe AMM similar to Balancer.
  swapMatchesPricing [ERROR/ERROR]
    Same issues as Balancer (complex pricing formula, div-by-zero).
    SVS: FP | CVL: FP (Division by zero)

SUMMARY
==============================================================================
          TP   TN   FP   FN   Error  Total
SVS:       0   13   13    0    0      26
CVL:       0    8   19    0    0      27

SVS Precision: N/A (no TP or FP count relevant since all safe)
CVL Precision: N/A

False Positive Rate:
SVS: 13/26 = 50.00% of rules are false alarms
CVL: 19/27 = 70.37% of rules are false alarms

Key findings:
- Safe contracts are the hardest for both tools to verify
- SVS successfully verifies 13/26 rules (50%), CVL only 8/27 (30%)
- External calls (IERC20, transfer), loops (Ballot delegate), and
  complex math (Balancer, Curve) are the main FP sources
- SVS handles simple ERC20 contracts better (CareerOnToken, StableDEX,
  WrappedToken all pass). CVL fails on most transfer/transferFrom rules.
